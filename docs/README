Step 2 [Optional]: Go install the Python APSW software if you want to
use blocktracking.

Step 3: Go install Interact
See more information in "INTERACT"

Step 4: Follow section a + c (b IF you want a irc bot)

a. Configure the config files found in the config folder - rename all
of them with .example.conf to .conf (skip to c for no irc bot)

b: Only rename irc.example.conf to irc.conf if you want to have a irc
bot for your server.

c: Rename and modify the .example.txt files to .txt

Step 5: Launch using Python..then get on and enjoy iCraft, as it
should now be working. Good luck with your server.

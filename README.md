# iCraft-Python3

Original untouched README file is located under docs/ folder.

This thing supports Python 3 and was initially modified for McLord Classic Server Parade 2023 to make sure I'm not under security risk by utilizing deprecated Python 2.

Please note that the software is still unstable and probably is not ready for production use. Any contributions are welcome.

Come and check out our LaserTaggedCTF server at ClassiCube. :)
